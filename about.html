                <p>SK Subang Bestari Recycling Initiative: Making the School a Centre for Community Recycling</p>
                <p>
                  Sekolah Kebangsaan Subang Bestari has launched an ongoing recycling initiative to make the school a
                  recycling hub for the school and local community. This initiative is scheduled to take place every
                  fourth week of every month, with the main aim of fostering a culture of recycling among students,
                  teachers, parents, and the local community.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <br>
                  This recycling program aims to:
                <ul>
                  <li>Reducing Waste Production: By collecting and recycling materials such as paper, plastic, glass,
                    and
                    metal, SK Subang Bestari hopes to reduce the amount of waste sent to landfills.</li>
                  <li>Educate the Community: Through this initiative, students and the community will better understand
                    the importance of recycling and the correct way to manage recyclable materials.</li>
                  <li>
                    Cultivating Environmental Awareness: This program also aims to cultivate a responsible attitude
                    towards the environment and make recycling a continuous daily practice.
                  </li>
                </ul>


                </p>


                <p>
                  PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION
                </p>
                <p>
                  Every month, on the fourth week, SK Subang Bestari will hold a recycling collection session. This
                  activity involves several main steps:
                <ol>
                  <li>Collection and Sorting: Students and community members are encouraged to bring their recyclables
                    to a designated area in the school. Officers will ensure that the materials are sorted by type
                    (paper, plastic, glass, metal, aluminum, used oil) to facilitate the recycling process.</li>
                  <li>Education and Awareness: Education sessions on recycling and waste management will also be held
                    during collection days. This includes talks, demonstrations, and interactive activities to increase
                    knowledge about recycling practices.</li>
                  <li>Cooperation with Local Authorities: SK Subang Bestari cooperates with local authorities and waste
                    management companies to ensure that the collected recyclable materials are sent to the appropriate
                    recycling center.
                  </li>
                  <li>Community Involvement: Commitment from all parties is key to the success of this initiative.
                    Students, teachers, parents, and the local community are invited to be actively involved. The
                    program also encourages the participation of parents and the community through campaigns and
                    promotions to increase awareness and involvement in recycling activities.
                  </li>
                </ol>
                </p>

                <p>
                  IMPACT AND HOPE
                </p>
                <p>
                  With the implementation of this program, SK Subang Bestari not only strives to preserve the
                  environment but also build a community that is more responsible and sensitive to environmental issues.
                  The school hopes that this initiative can encourage more schools and communities to practice recycling
                  and participate in efforts to care for the earth.
                </p>
                <p>SK Subang Bestari's recycling initiative is a good example of promoting green practices and showing
                  how schools can act as centers of education and recycling collection for the local community.
